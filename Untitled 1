it is comprised of doing logic with the pieces and players.

the board: responsible for the logic.

will hold the number of pieces for player 1 and 2.
will check the available moves on the board.
will check who won.
responsible for flipping colors.

TODO: figure out what to do with pieces and players.

view:

the board: a 8x8 uncheckered board
the pieces: black and white pieces.

put all of that shit in a border pane. 

display player 1 stats on top left
display player 2 stats on top right

have indicators for each players to indicate where they can
place pieces down. (color of the players) (have it blink?)

after game ends, show a panel of who won at the end.
thats all!

have an AI mode that will play (perhaps)
